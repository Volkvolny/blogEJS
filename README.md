# blogEJS

While learning EJS, Node.JS, and Express, I was challenged by my class to create a simple blog where you could create posts through going to the compose route, and from there get redirected to the home page. All entries would display on the home page and you could click read more to visit a page with the full blog post. Pages are done with EJS templates.
